Quoted Ploppy : 
"Suffice it to say I have just finished converting Mark's original Visual Studio 6 Blitz3D source code 
to Visual Studio 2010's framework.  Apart from the 'upgrade' in VS versions and the conversion of depreciated functions, 
the source code remains the same.

So here it is, for anyone that would like to use it to create their own version of B3D using VS2010/VS2013. 
Remember to follow Mark's readme file (still of course included in my version) for a correct compile. 
And don't forget to include fmod.dll in the bin folder. "
